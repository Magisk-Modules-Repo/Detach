### :grey_question: <b>Common Question and Answers:</b>

#### Q: I have a problem, where do I report it?

A: Ask on Telegram group or/and on XDA OP (scroll up)

#### Q: When are the changes applied after the first flash ?

A: After you will have reboot your device.

#### Q: And the `detach.custom` file, what happened?

A: Starting from version `4.X`, there is no longer need of this file, you just have to use the `Detach.txt` file.

#### Q: Where to find an app's package name for an other app (custom app) ?

A: App's package name is in the middle of the two texts framed in grey<br />
`https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=`com.package.name`&hl=en`

#### Q: Apps aren't hidden in my Play Store!

A: If you have already run the command `su -c detach -id`, report on the Telegram group.<br />

#### Q: How to "attach" again an app who is previously "hidden" ?

A:  Just comment again the app name or the corresponding package name in the `/sdcard/Detach.txt` file and wait some minutes/hours. Or you can remove Play Store's app data, but you will lose your Play Store update and search history.

#### Q: What does this module do? Does it touch the system partition ?

A: It only edits a SQL database file in Play Store folder on your `/data` partition. Nothing more, nothing less.

#### Q: After several hours, my detached app(s) are back in my Play Store, what's wrong ?

A: With a recent update of the Play Store, an unknow wakeloks refresh the SQL database file of the Play Store.
To fix it: just install a Terminal Emulator app or Termux (or another terminal emulator app) and run the command:
=> `su -c detach -id`

#### Q: My Play Store history search will be deleted ?

A: <b>ONLY</b> if you select the `-c` option in the terminal menu (as indicated in the menu).

#### Q: Is it possible to add or remove app(s) from the module's setup ?

A: Yes! See below:
- For adding:
    - `su -c detach -a` (or `su -c detach --add-app`)

- And for removing:
    - `su -c detach -r` (or `su -c detach --rem-app`)

#### Q: And if I'm too lazy to do the detach command every time the Play Store updates its file?

A: You can schedule the `su -c detach -id` command
- To do this, just do:
    - Run `su -c detach -t` (or `su -c detach --task-scheduler`) command in your terminal
    - Choose a way.
